          HI! Welcome to my site. Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I've alwasy been a big city person, but I grew up in a very small town of one thousand people. I had larger dreams so I left the central coast of the Great Lakes, to move to the West Coast. I moved here inspired by a small local band called Modest Mouse. I like most other people in the PNW like being outdoors, lately I've been doing a lot of biking, but previously I ran distance and have done around 7 half marathons like the rock and roll and the Seattle. Solo I cannot even remember the number of miles I have run. I have a dog named Sauce. He is a goofy guy! He is a German Shepard and Black Lab mix. I like to tell him hes Alsatian and not German.

      <p class="goals">
          My goals vary from day to day. Sometimes I want to work with companies like Epic emr because there are many bits in their program that drive myself and my co-workers a little bit batty. Other days I want to do things like rebuild a now defunct app from the 2010's called cocktail compass. Other days i think it would be nice if you could point your phone at mountains and it would tell you which they were, how far away, and some other things about them.
